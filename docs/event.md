# Event System

    The purpose of the event system is to have interactable objects in the
    game. This is meant to decouple the interaction code from the level 
    code. The first implementation will be for displaying text when a 
    player presses enter while touching an object. "Like a sign"

## Mechanics

    - Triggers pygame event
    - On-touch + enter key triggers
