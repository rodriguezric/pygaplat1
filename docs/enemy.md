# Enemy

    Enemies in this game are similar to the basic hazzard and the player.
    - They hurt the player when they touch it
    - They use the same physics as the player

## Design Steps
    
    - Create a mobile entity that uses player physics.
    - Create an interaction between entities and the player.
    - Implement the interaction as a kill sequence, just like hazzard.
    - Design different behaviors of the enemy.
